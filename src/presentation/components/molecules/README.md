# Molecules

Molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. They are formed by combining atoms together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound.

## Guidelines

- Combine multiple atoms to create a more complex, single-purpose component
- Keep the component focused on one key functionality
- Maintain consistent patterns in molecule construction
- Consider the relationships between atoms within the molecule
- Test molecules as a unit
