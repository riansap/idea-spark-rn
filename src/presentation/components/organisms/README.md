# Organisms

Organisms are complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. They form distinct sections of an interface.

## Guidelines

- Create complex, distinct sections of the interface
- Combine molecules and atoms to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface
- Maintain clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- Consider the component's role in the larger application context
- Implement proper state management when necessary

## Components

- GlobalBottomSheet: A complex bottom sheet component that manages its own state and combines multiple atoms
- TaskCreationMenu: A form organism that combines multiple input fields, buttons, and manages complex state
