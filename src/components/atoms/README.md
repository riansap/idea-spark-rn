# Atoms

Atoms are the smallest possible components, such as buttons, titles, inputs or event color pallets, animations, and fonts. They can be applied on any context, globally or within other components and layouts.

## Guidelines

- Keep components as simple and single-purpose as possible
- Avoid internal state unless absolutely necessary
- Minimize dependencies on other components
- Focus on reusability across the entire application
- Document props clearly and provide default values where appropriate

## Components

- Button: Basic button component with various styles and sizes
- IconContext: Component for rendering icons with contextual styling
- TextInput: Basic input component with various styles and types
- LoadingOverlay: Component for displaying a loading overlay
